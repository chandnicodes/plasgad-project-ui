How it works
DEVELOPING & ADJUSTING THE PERFECT TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FOR YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN NEEDS

Smart Sticker
Is a critical part of stock traceability, through barcode, QR code or passive RFID tag that is scanned to collect tracking data along a supply chain. This is incredibly useful for tagging individual items at a relatively low cost so they can be tracked as they enter different readable gates along the supply chain. 

+ TAG
Involves any device that gathers or conveys information with another device. This process involves active RFID, Bluetooth, WPS (WIFI Positioning System), GPS, and Micro Geolocation. The device sends live online alerts according to specified criteria, which enables real-time problem identification, solving bottlenecks, improving the service and reducing costs.
